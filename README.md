Scripts for GxE analysis and plotting of the four CIMMYT nursery trails - ESWYT, IDYN, HTWYT, and SAWYT. 
The scripts are used for the data analysis and result plotting of paper: Xiong W, et al. Increased ranking chnage in wheat breeding under climate change. Nature Plant (Accepted).  

These are Jupter-notebook scripts. You need to download and install jupyter-notebook to run the python scripts.
All data for plotting can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/E3UF3R. Specifying the data directory in the scripts, you can reanalyze the data and plots the results.

Improvement of the scripts are ongoing. 

Any request to these scripts please contact Wei Xiong (xiongwei8848@hotmail.com).
